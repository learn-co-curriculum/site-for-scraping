You'll meet every day with your team in person and move through the course together. You will also be part of a larger cohort made up of 3-5 teams in different locations. Instructors will work with you full-time to help you succeed.</p> <h3>Expectations</h3> <p>Students must be available to learn full-time Monday to Friday, 9:00am - 6:00pm, at a minimum (there will be a lot of additional work beyond those hours that you may choose to complete with your team or independently). Additionally, students will be expected to meet in-person with their teams from 10:00am - 3:00pm in a Flatiron provided coworking space. All other work may be done from any location.</p> </article> </div> </section> <br> <section class=instructors-box> <div class=container> <div class=row> <header class=col-xs-12> <h2>What a Typical Day Looks Like</h2> </header> </div> <div class=row> <article class=col-lg-12> <p><b>9:00 - 9:30:</b> Team Standups: Every morning you'll start your day by meeting with your team, in person or via video conference, to review what you worked on the day before and what you'll be working on that day.</p> <p><b>9:30 - 10:00:</b> Cohort Standups: Video conference with your entire cohort, including Flatiron instructors, to touch base, review progress, and kick off the day. You'll get to know other students around the country, and see what they are working on.</p> <p><b>10:00 - 12:00:</b> Coworking with Teammates: We're huge proponents of pair programing and group colaboration. Everyone contributes something different, and has a different background to pull from, which makes collaborating so valuable. You'll meet with your team at the coworking space to work on assignments and projects together, helping each other solve problems, and move forward in the course together.</p> <p><b>12:00 - 1:00:</b> Lunch Break: The program is hard, but sure you take a break, enjoy the area around the coworking space, and get to know your team members a little better.</p> <p><b>1:00 - 3:00:</b> Continue coworking with teammates.</p> <p><b>3:00 - 6:00:</b> Independent or team-based work, plus scheduled one-on-one sessions with your Flatiron instructor. After 3:00, you'll be free to take care of personal responsibilities if you need to, work from home, or stay and continue to work with your teammates. You'll also have a scheduled one-on-one video chat with a Flatiron instructor once a week to catch up on your progress. </p> <p><b>6:00 - ?:</b> After 6:00, you'll still have a lot of work to get done, especially when you are working on your projects. You'll want to use this time to watch lectures, catch up on assignments, write blog posts, and present at technical meetups in your city on interesting things you've been working on or learning. We'll help you prepare for any presentations you are going to do.</p> </article> </div> </div> </section> <section class=container> <div class=row> <article class=col-lg-2></article> <article class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12"> <h3>Working with Your Instructors</h3> <p>You'll have full-time access to Flatiron instructors 9:00AM-6:00PM, Monday-Friday, via video conference, chat, and email, to work through assignments, do code reviews, and pair on difficult problems.</p> </article> <article class="curriculum-box col-xs-12"></article> </div> </section> <section class=container> <div class="curriculum-box row"> <article class=col-xs-12> <h2>Locations</h2> </article> <article class=col-sm-6> <h3>Washington, DC</h3> </article> <article class=col-sm-6> <h3>Philadelphia, PA</h3> </article> </div> </section> <section class=container> <div class=row> <article class=col-lg-2></article> <article class="col-xs-12 text-center"> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> </article> <article class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12"> <h4>Q: Is the Curriculum any Different than the On-Campus Program?</h4> <p>No. The Immersive curriculum is identical to the on-campus program, and designed to give students the skills necessary to work as software engineers. In addition to the technical work, students will be required to maintain active technical blogs, present at local meetups, and interact with guest speakers from the industry. Learning to code is just the minimum bar for being a developer. We go way beyond that.</p> <h4>Q: Why Local?</h4> <p>Education is not about content or curriculum. It’s not about a great textbook or an amazing lecture. It’s about people. Learning happens when passionate, motivated people connect around big ideas. We love the internet, and are excited about the potential for remote learning. But until we can replicate the high-5’s that come after completing long debugging sessions, or the serendipitous learning that happens when students overhear the conversations that happen next to them, we will continue to believe that the most effective learning happens when people are physically together. One of the most important components of the Flatiron School experience is the friendships formed by going through this rigorous program together with highly motivated and intelligent classmates. The local immersive will be no different in that regard.</p> <h4>Q: Why DC and Philadelphia?</h4> <p>We're excited to be a part of these cities' emerging tech communities, and have already partnered with local employers to help graduates kick off their careers. As we’ve stated elsewhere, there is tremendous value in <a target=_blank href="http://qr.ae/ltvpF">being in the city in which you hope to launch your career</a>. We'll also be announcing more cities before the summer.</p> <h4>Q: What Type of Computer Do I Need?</h4> <p>You will need a Macbook that can run the most recent Operating System (right now, that's Yosemite).</p> <h4>Q: What is the Application Process?</h4> <p>The application process for the Local Immersive is the same as the one for the on-campus program. There will be two interviews: one cultural and one technical. Once you're accepted, you will need to complete the pre-work, which amounts to about 50-100 hours of work. See <a target=_blank href="http://www.quora.com/How-can-I-best-prepare-for-Flatiron-Schools-admissions-process">here for more information on how to best prepare for the admissions process</a>.</p> <h4>Q: Are there any Scholarships?</h4> <p>First focus on getting accepted into the program. We have a very high bar for acceptance, but once a student is admitted we work very hard to make it affordable through a combination of grants and financing options.</p> <h4>Q: Is there job placement support?</h4> <p>Yes. Once students complete the program they have the same support from our placements team as all Flatiron School students. Here’s a post that details some of the ways in which we <a target=_blank href="http://qr.ae/ltvRH">help students kick off their careers as software developers</a>.</p> <h4>Q: Will I have access to the Flatiron School alumni community?</h4> <p>Absolutely. As a graduate of the program you will not only have access to our unparalleled job placement program but you will have full access to the alumni community and benefits, from lifetime career support to an incredible, highly curated, peer network. Here’s an overview of just <a target=_blank href="http://qr.ae/DbV5P">a few of the ways in which we engage with our alumni</a>.</p> </article> <article class="curriculum-box col-xs-12"></article> </div> </section> <section class="container value-box"> <div class=row> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12"> <a target=_blank href="http://go.flatironschool.com/remote-immersive" class="btn-default btn">Apply</a> </div> </div> </section> </main> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footer-widgets clearfix"> <div class="footer-widgets-wrap clearfix"> <div id=text-4 class="footer-widget widget_text"> <h2 class=widgettitle>Contact Us</h2> <div class=textwidget> <p><a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ArbiA">The Flatiron School<br/>11 Broadway, Suite 260<br/>New York, NY 10004</a><br/><br/> <i class=icon-phone style="padding-right: 3px;"></i>1-888-958-0569<br/> <i class=icon-envelope style="padding-right: 3px;"></i> <a href="mailto:info@flatironschool.com">info@flatironschool.com</a></p> </div> </div> <div id=recent-posts-2 class="footer-widget widget_recent_entries"> <h2 class=widgettitle> <a href="http://blog.flatironschool.com">Recent Blog Posts</a> </h2> <ul id=tumblr_feed> </ul> </div> <div id=ok-twitter-4 class="footer-widget ok-twitter"> <div class=twitter-widget> <h2 class=widgettitle> Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/flatironschool">@FlatironSchool</a> </h2> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=clear></div> <div class=footer> <div class=footer-text> <div class=footer-text-left> <div class=menu> <ul> <li> <a href="index.html"> <i class="icon-home icon-2x"></i> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://twitter.com/flatironschool"> <i class="icon-twitter icon-2x"></i> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FlatironSchool"> <i class="icon-facebook-sign icon-2x"></i> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://instagram.com/flatironschool"> <i class="icon-camera-retro icon-2x"></i> </a> </li> <li> <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/the-flatiron-school"> <i class="icon-linkedin-sign icon-2x"></i> </a> </li> <li> <a href="https://github.com/flatiron-school"> <i class="icon-github-alt icon-2x"></i> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class=footer-text-right> <div class=copyright>&copy; 2014.
